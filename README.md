## What is it

It's a little Node / Express app that's just a slideshow. 9 x hard coded facts / figures

### Getting started

Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM installed.<br>
Run ``` npm install ``` to get the packages you need.<br>
Once that's done, ``` grunt ``` will get you running on ``` localhost:3000 ``` with sass watching.

### The offline version

```grunt offline``` will package up the app in a single html file.
